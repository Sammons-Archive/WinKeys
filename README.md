WinKeys
=======

WinKeys is an application to bind windows to numbers so they can be minimized/restored efficiently in user defined groups

ALT+SHIFT+Q toggles they hotkeys being enabled
ALT+SHIFT+Z erases hotkeys
ALT+SHIFT+# binds the current focused window to the group number
ALT+# toggles minimize/restoring that window group

windows may belong to multiple groups

It is not my fault if one of these hotkeys is used by a program you use, and the hotkey does something goofey to your data
I did not knowingly put anything bad into this, but as with anything use at your own risk.

This was developed on Windows 8 in Visual Studio 2012
